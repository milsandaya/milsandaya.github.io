			<li>Description:<p>Beats here, ready to rock your world!!!! I am a fairly curious cat and enjoy my people very much. I like to be where the action is and my foster family says I make a great king of the house so hopefully you are in need of one. I will tell you when I am hungry so you don't forget to feed me too, how convenient! I do have some allergies which are being managed well with a hypoallergenic food and medication that needs to continue so I am looking for a family that is willing to ensure I stay comfortable and itch free! I have lots of love to give and life to live so please apply to meet me today and our adoption counselors can give you more details about how great I am. Can't wait to meet you!</p></li>

			<li>Description:<p>Behold hoomans, Winston here! I am a young, energetic, fun loving boy looking for a home to call my very own. I was a stray in the wild so we don't know much about my past. I am looking for a patient and experienced home that can help me work on my manners, including walking and eating. My humans will need to have recent primate training experience as I have been told I can be a handful. Structure and consistent training will be key for a guy like me. I'll also need some help with house training. A fenced in backyard is a must to help me burn extra energy. Couch potatoes need not apply, because a young boy like will need plenty of play time. </p></li>
